This is my personal website! I tried my best to style it as cleanly as possible. I used a mostly monochromatic color scheme for the website, with the only color exceptions being the images. Even the links are gray, or black when selected or hovered. On the home page (index.html), I included a quick description about myself and the website under the "About Me" section. Underneath that, I have a section for my projects (more like project, haha!). Underneath that section, I have a simple unordered list of links through which one could contact me or view more of my work.

On the Resume page (resume.html), I have pretty much an HTML recreation of my PDF resume. I utilized as many common stylistic elements as I could from the Home page, including heading styles. I had to define a new class ".resume-entry" as well as its corresponding fields ".resume-entry-title", etc. to format the resume entries in such a way that they appear within the HTML in a semantically sensible order.

If I had more time, I wish I could have added more projects to my Projects section (it's been a while since I've had time to code something for fun!) and tinkered with the color scheme or fonts a little bit more. I don't know, there's something bothering me about my h3 heading style not matching with my higher headings h1, h2.
